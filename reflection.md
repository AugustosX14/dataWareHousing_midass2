# Reflection on Data Warehousing Assignment

In this activity, I learned why data is separated into fact and dimension tables in a star schema design. Fact tables store measurable metrics like birth counts, while dimensions provide descriptive context such as time periods, state categories, and gender labels.(I can easily I distinguish fact table because it's like the key to every dimension like in order to open one dimesion you can find the key from fact table) If everything was stored in one large table, it would create significant redundancy, make queries slower, and increase the risk of data inconsistency when updates are needed. Using a star schema helps us query efficiently and scale better for analytics by separating concerns and reducing data duplication. The main challenge is in designing clear relationships between fact and dimension tables, but once properly structured, analysis becomes much simpler and more maintainable. I can see how this approach is extremely useful in real business scenarios like BrightBeginnings, where understanding naming trends per state and decade is essential for planning inventory, marketing strategies, and business expansion decisions.
